## Overview
Project name: TinderHack <br>
Project description: Our app allows users who participate in a hackathon to connect with each other and form teams in a quick and interactive manner. Users will be able to see any teams that match their interests and skills that are still looking for additional members and vice versa.

## Inspiration
One of the difficulties of participating in a hackathon is finding the right teams or members to complement your expertise. Most hackathons connect their uses through a forum page which can be unintuitive as users have to manually filter through the list of participants and receiving a response after reaching out can be a hit or miss. We wanted to make a platform that provides a simple and interactive way to match users and teams with the same skill sets, similar to the dating apps we know today such as Tinder and Bumble.

## What it does
Users will be able to create a profile on the platforms displaying their username, contact information, and most importantly, their technical skills. Other users will then be match with them based on their status as an individual or team, and what the matching users bring to the table. The user can accept or decline the match provided by the platform. If accepted, a request will be send to the other party, who will then see anyone who matched with their profile. If both sides accept the match, they will be added to the same team and a way to contact each other will be shared between the two parties.

## How we built it
We used MERN stack for our frontend and backend. We also utilize Firebase for backend-as-a-service and implemented Twilio to notify users about their matches.
